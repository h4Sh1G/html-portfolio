<h1>Alexandre's Watched Movies</h1>
<h2>My finest selection</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Best anime I ever watched, even surpassed dragon ball if you want to consider it an anime.
For me it has everything, history, background, action, twists.</p>
<h3>Avengers</h3>
<p>I really enjoy marvel movies, and I choose this one because it is the culminate of every marvel movie, with different heroes. 
Here we can see them all together with their own abilities fighting a common villain.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>This one is a must, for me one of leonardo di caprio's best movies, it has tension, twists and an absolute mind blowing history</p>
